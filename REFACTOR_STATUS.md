# Refactor Status - Bank System Simplification

## 🎉 BACKEND REFACTOR COMPLETE!

All backend code has been successfully refactored to use the simplified Bank + Credits system.

**What Changed:**
- ❌ Removed complex debt tracking with separate debt table
- ❌ Removed automatic debt transfers between players
- ✅ Added simple per-player `credits_owed` field
- ✅ Simplified cashout: player repays own credits, gets available cash
- ✅ Bank tracks all money flows centrally
- ✅ All tests passing (4 scenarios: A, B, C, D)

## ✅ COMPLETED

### 1. Bank Model Updated
- `Bank.outstanding_debt` → `Bank.total_credits_issued` / `total_credits_repaid`
- `record_cashout()` now takes `credits_repaid` instead of `debt_settled`
- Added `validate_cashout()` method
- Simplified to track credits per-player

### 2. Player Model Updated
- Added `Player.credits_owed` field to track credit owed to bank

### 3. BankDAL Updated
- `record_credit_buyin()` - issues credits without separate debt table
- `record_cashout()` - tracks credit repayment

### 4. TransactionService Partially Updated
- Removed `debt_dal` import and initialization
- `approve_transaction()` updates `Player.credits_owed` instead of creating debt records
- `process_cashout_with_debt_settlement()` - SIMPLIFIED (no automatic debt transfers)
- `execute_cashout_debt_operations()` - SIMPLIFIED (updates Player.credits_owed)
- `get_player_transaction_summary()` - returns `credits_owed` instead of debt

### Services and API - COMPLETED ✅
- [x] TransactionService fully refactored - all debt references removed
- [x] GameService updated - returns credits instead of debts
- [x] AdminService updated - no debt collection deletion
- [x] API endpoints updated:
  - [x] Removed `debt_dal` import
  - [x] Replaced `/api/games/<game_id>/debts` with `/api/games/<game_id>/credits`
  - [x] Updated game status to return `total_credits_repaid` instead of `total_debt_settled`
  - [x] Updated admin stats to calculate `total_credits_owed` instead of `total_debts`
  - [x] Updated destroy_game to use admin_service
  - [x] Updated game report to use credits

### Tests - COMPLETED ✅
- [x] Updated `test_cashout_scenarios.py` to work with credit system
- [x] Replaced debt assertions with credit assertions
- [x] All 4 test scenarios passing (A, B, C, D)

### Debt Files Removed - COMPLETED ✅
- [x] Deleted `src/dal/debt_dal.py`
- [x] Deleted `src/models/debt.py`
- [x] Verified tests still pass after removal

## ⏳ REMAINING WORK (OPTIONAL)

## 🐛 ADMIN FIX

### Issue
Admin enters game and sees: "Player OMRI_C not found in game. Please rejoin the game."

### Root Cause
Frontend expects logged-in user to be in players list. Admin is not a player.

### Solution (Frontend Fix)
In `web-ui/src/app/components/game/game.component.ts` around line 764:

```typescript
// BEFORE:
} else {
  const attemptedName = this.currentUser.username || this.currentUser.name;
  console.warn('Current player not found in players list...');
  this.showError(`Player "${attemptedName}" not found in game. Please rejoin the game.`);
}

// AFTER:
} else {
  // Check if user is admin viewing the game
  if (this.isAdminViewing()) {
    // Set up admin as viewer with host privileges
    this.currentPlayer = {
      name: 'Admin',
      user_id: this.currentUser.id,
      is_host: true,
      active: true,
      // ... other required fields
    };
    this.isHost = true;
  } else {
    const attemptedName = this.currentUser.username || this.currentUser.name;
    console.warn('Current player not found in players list...');
    this.showError(`Player "${attemptedName}" not found in game. Please rejoin the game.`);
  }
}
```

Add method to detect admin viewing:
```typescript
isAdminViewing(): boolean {
  // Check if route has admin parameter or user has admin role
  return this.route.snapshot.queryParams['admin'] === 'true' ||
         this.currentUser?.role === 'admin';
}
```

## 📋 COMPLETED STEPS ✅

1. ✅ Bank model updated to use credits
2. ✅ Player.credits_owed field added
3. ✅ TransactionService completely refactored
4. ✅ GameService and AdminService updated
5. ✅ API endpoints updated
6. ✅ All tests fixed and passing
7. ✅ Debt_dal files removed

## 🚀 SYSTEM READY

The backend refactor is **100% complete**. The system now uses:
- **Bank entity** - tracks all cash and credits centrally
- **Player.credits_owed** - simple per-player credit tracking
- **Simplified cashout** - no automatic debt transfers
- **Host approval** - required for all money movements

All 4 test scenarios pass successfully demonstrating the new flow works correctly.
