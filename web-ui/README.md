## API Endpoints

### Authentication
- `POST /api/auth/login` - Authenticate user

### Games
- `POST /api/games` - Create new game
- `POST /api/games/join` - Join existing game
- `GET /api/games/{id}` - Get game details
- `GET /api/games/{id}/status` - Get game status
- `GET /api/games/{id}/players` - Get players list
- `POST /api/games/{id}/end` - End game
- `GET /api/games/{code}/link` - Generate join link and QR code

### Transactions
- `POST /api/transactions/buyin` - Create buy-in request
- `POST /api/transactions/cashout` - Create cashout request
- `GET /api/games/{id}/transactions/pending` - Get pending transactions
- `POST /api/transactions/{id}/approve` - Approve transaction
- `POST /api/transactions/{id}/reject` - Reject transaction

### Players
- `GET /api/games/{id}/players/{userId}/summary` - Get player summary

### Debts
- `GET /api/games/{id}/debts` - Get game debts
- `GET /api/games/{id}/settlement` - Get settlement data

## Game Flow

1. **Host creates game** â†’ Gets unique game code
2. **Players join** via code or QR scan
3. **Players buy-in** â†’ Host approves transactions
4. **Game progresses** with real-time status updates
5. **Players cashout** â†’ Automatic debt transfers occur
6. **Host ends game** â†’ Final summaries sent to all players

## Debt Transfer System

The system automatically handles debt transfers during cashouts:

- When a player cashes out, they may receive debts from inactive players
- Debts are reassigned from "owed to game" to "owed to player"
- Both creditor and debtor receive notifications about transfers
- Final game summaries show complete debt relationships

## Development

### Running in Development Mode

```bash
# Terminal 1: Start Angular dev server
cd web-ui
npm start

# Terminal 2: Start Flask API server
python src/api/web_api.py

# Terminal 3: Ensure MongoDB is running
mongod
```

### Building for Production

```bash
cd web-ui
npm run build
```

The built files will be in `web-ui/dist/chipmate-web/`

## Environment Configuration

### Frontend (environment.ts)
```typescript
export const environment = {
  production: false,
  apiUrl: 'http://localhost:5000/api',
  appUrl: 'http://localhost:4200'
};
```

### Backend Environment Variables
- `MONGO_URL`: MongoDB connection string (default: `mongodb://localhost:27017/`)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CORS Issues**: Ensure the Flask API has CORS configured for your Angular dev server URL
2. **MongoDB Connection**: Verify MongoDB is running and accessible at the configured URL
3. **Port Conflicts**: Default ports are 4200 (Angular) and 5000 (Flask) - change if needed
4. **QR Code Generation**: Requires `qrcode` and `pillow` Python packages

### Browser Compatibility

- Chrome 90+
- Firefox 88+
- Safari 14+
- Edge 90+
