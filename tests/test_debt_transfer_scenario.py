"""
Test for complex debt transfer scenario with 3 users:
A, B, C. A buys for 100 cash, B buys for 100 cash, C buys for 300 credit.
C cashes out for 0, B cashes out for 200, A cashes out for 300.
Expected: B gets 100 cash + 100 C's debt, A gets 100 cash + 200 C's debt.
C should owe 100 to B and 200 to A.
