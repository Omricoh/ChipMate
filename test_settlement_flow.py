# Diana cashes out 300 chips: 0 cash + 70 unpaid credit from herself (remaining)
# Wait, this doesn't make sense. Let me recalculate...
# Diana owes 120 unpaid credit. Alice claimed 50, so 70 remains.
# But Diana has 300 chips total. She already returned 80 chips.
# So she has 220 chips left. She should claim the remaining unpaid credits from herself? No...
# Actually, let me think about this differently.

# The scenario is:
# - Diana bought in for 200 credit, got 200 chips
# - She repaid 80 chips, so she has 120 chips left
# - 120 credit remains unpaid (Diana owes this)
# - Alice already claimed 50 of Diana's unpaid credit
# - 70 of Diana's unpaid credit remains

# For final cashout, Diana can't cash out because she has no cash priority and can't claim her own unpaid credits
# Let's say Diana has 120 chips and wants to cash out. She can only claim others' unpaid credits (but there are none)
# Or take cash if available (but that would go to those with cash priority first)

# Let me simplify: Diana with 120 chips takes remaining cash (0 priority but takes what's left) + 0 credits
print("\n  Diana cashes out 120 chips: 0 cash + claims remaining from others...")
# Actually, there are no other unpaid credits, only Diana's own

# Let me check bank balance
bank = bank_dal.get_by_game(game_id)
print(f"\n  Bank cash balance: {bank.cash_balance}")

# If bank has 0 cash left, Diana can't cash out unless there are other unpaid credits
# This scenario shows a limitation: if Diana owes unpaid credit and has no cash priority,
# she can only cash out by claiming other players' unpaid credits (which don't exist here)

# For the test, let's say Diana forfeits or we add another player with unpaid credit
# Skip Diana's cashout for now
